# EzyLoRA
Simplifying init, format, BLIP caption and settings for kohya_ss LoRA training

# Install 
This script is based on [kohya_ss](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss). Follow the installation instructions for that.
Install the requirements for ezylora with `python venv` by running
```
chmod +x install.sh ezylora.py
./install.sh
```

# Run
Before running ezylora, start a session of kohya_ss from its installation folder by running:
```
./gui.sh --listen=0.0.0.0 --headless
```
Make sure kohya_ss is running by navigating to its UI at `localhost:7860`. 
From ezylora folder, call the script with the following required arguments after sourcing the environment:
```
source venv/bin/activate
./ezylora.py --lora_name 'your LoRA name' --src_path 'path/to/training/image/set'
```
For a full list of arguments, call `ezylora -h`:

```
usage: ezylora.py [-h] --lora_name LORA_NAME --src_path SRC_PATH [--dst_path DST_PATH] [--rename_pics] [--endpoint ENDPOINT]
